<h1>Final Project for CIDM 4382 - </h1> 
<p>This is an application that allows you </p>
<p>to choose an animal and then it takes the </p>
<p>animal you choose and you can see the</p>
<p>information regarding that animal. </p>

<p>I took a lot of the guts from the airplanes
project in order to make this one. My mongodb information is in a JSON file
connected to to mlab and that is how I'm pulling information. 
You will find that it is connecting the data chosen on the airport view (Animals available) will output 
on the climb view (Animal Information). It takes the data chosen from airport,
which is still labeled as things related to the airplane application
I just changed the information to relate to the information I needed to output,
and I found there were too many things to change internally, so I kept everything
basically the same, just changed the information being outputted. I made more things clear in the folders where you 
will find things. I also put some notes in the code to make it more clear on what
I tried doing. Thank you. </p>
